Dark matter haloes contain a multitude of information about cosmology, particle physics, and galactic astrophysics. This thesis attempts to decouple the astrophysical effects on the radial distribution within haloes. We statistically explore this relaxation response across various haloes in realistic cosmological simulations from IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. We characterize them accurately with a simple quasi-adiabatic model that accounts for astrophysical feedback effects and an explicit dependence on halo-centric distance. Through extensive CAMELS simulations, we analyze how variations in feedback implementation affect halo relaxation across different epochs, revealing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. While the amount of feedback outflows has a strong effect on relaxation, their exact nature seems irrelevant. EAGLE simulations with a variety of astrophysical models further show that the gas equation of state strongly influences relaxation alongside feedback effects. By examining the dynamical evolution of relaxation in halo populations from $z=5$ to $z=0$, we statistically investigate possible causal connections with astrophysical processes such as star formation, and the production of wind and metals. These connections typically manifest immediately in inner regions, but with a 2 to 3 Gyr delay in the outer halo, elucidating the dependence on halo-centric distance. These findings can enhance baryonification schemes and semi-analytical models. Lastly, we develop a spherical self-similar model, incorporating radiative cooling and artificial viscosity to accreting gas, that mimics the formation of a galaxy disk. By evolving gas and dark matter self-consistently, we produce halo relaxation responses in this tractable system that qualitatively match full simulations. Initial applications reveal that, besides accretion rate, the gas equation of state significantly affects halo relaxation, aligning with findings from EAGLE simulations.

I will start by acknowledging the universe for having had sufficiently random fluctuations that allowed for the formation of self-sustaining entities such as humans, that continuously increase their correlation with the universe through a systematic process of building knowledge through science. In the contemporary era of science, research like this is made possible through the funds contributed by every common citizen, through organizations like UGC and research institutions like IUCAA; I am honored to be part of this. I would not have been here if not for the limitless curiosity I was born with, which was constantly nurtured by my loving family, supportive teachers, and caring friends, for which I am infinitely grateful.

Foremost of all, I am grateful to my advisor, Prof. Aseem Paranjape, for seeing my potential, training me as a professional researcher, and making this thesis possible. I feel that he did one of the most difficult jobs of understanding my research interests, arguments, interpretations, and explanations, and guiding me in the right direction. I also want to acknowledge him for introducing me to this fascinating research at the interface of cosmology and galactic astrophysics. This thesis would not have been possible without his sincere effort and utmost priority in making sure that I always stayed on track in my research, while also giving me sufficient independence to express my potential to the maximum. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for encouraging me at the right times by making me realize my own potential.

I would like to thank my RAC members, Prof. Nishikanta Khandai and Prof. Nishant Singh, for regularly following up on my research work and providing useful comments that helped shape this thesis. In addition, I would also like to acknowledge the useful discussions with several other professors, including Kandaswamy Subramanian, Raghunathan Srianand, Susmita Adhikari, Arka Banerjee, Subhabrata Majumdar, Shadab Alam, and Ravi Sheth.

I would like to thank my collaborator, Sujatha Ramakrishnan, with whom I had the opportunity to author my first paper. She introduced me and gave me the courage to communicate research work through journal publication and respond to referee comments.

I would like to thank several other researchers I got to meet and discuss with at conferences, who are at a similar stage of research career as myself. I am grateful for the useful interactions with Ayan Nanda, Manush Manju, Ashu, Farman, and Barun, among others.

I would like to thank my seniors, Divya Rana, Labanya Kumar, Bhaskar Arya, Aromal P, Vishal, Amit, Navin, Soumak, Chabra, Swagat, and others for guiding me both academically and personally at different times. And I sincerely appreciate the support of my batchmates, Bikram Pradhan, Ankush Mandal, Kishore G, Soumya, Partha, Tatagata, Suprovo, Kavitha, Meenakshi, Sukanya, Priyanka, and also Shiva and Manan, who were helpful in various ways.

I also would like to thank several of my academic juniors, including Pushpak Pandey, Sayak Dutta, Eshita Banerjee, Dhruv Pandya, Snehil, Ranit, Saee, Suraj, Soumil, Prathamesh, Manish, Rajendra, Gopal, Raghav, Sudir, Anirban, Prasanth, Biplab, Sourav, and others for making my life at IUCAA wonderful. And I also thank the useful interactions with several post-doc researchers, including Sneha, Chiranjeeb, Megha, Chayan, Saikrubha, Preetish, Tek Adhikari, Atrideb, Prasia and several others.
Also, I would like to thank science communicator Akash Balaji, who kept me updated about the latest science and made me realize the beauty of the scientific research that I perform.

Finally I would like to thank the IUCAA administration, directors and deans who have ensured the stable and efficient functioning of the institute. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Mr Alok Mishra for supporting me in the process of thesis submission.

While I am definitely grateful to everyone who made me what I am today and in making this thesis possible, I could not mention every name here. All such interactions, including those off the record, will stay in my memories forever.
