\chapter{Introduction}
In the standard paradigm of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter haloes are formed from the gravitational collapse around initial overdensities - Galaxies are then formed the baryonic matter within the haloes - dark halo response to the galaxy formation - literature on adiabatic relaxation.
