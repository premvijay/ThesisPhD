\section{Dark matter haloes}

The concept of dark matter, which makes up over 80\% of all matter in the Universe as per the Lambda-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, is fundamental to modern cosmology. For nearly a century, dark matter is inferred exclusively through its gravitational effects and remains invisible to electromagnetic observations. The presence of dark matter was initially hypothesized to account for discrepancies in the rotational speeds of galaxies and the gravitational lensing of light that could not be explained by the visible matter alone.

Dark matter is believed to be crucial in the formation and evolution of the Universe's large-scale structure. Tiny fluctuations in the initial density field, for example those originating from quantum perturbations in the early Universe, grow over time due to gravitational instability. These perturbations eventually collapse to form gravitationally bound structures known as dark matter haloes \citep[][]{1974ApJ...187..425P,2002PhR...372....1C}. These haloes act as the fundamental units in building the large scale structure of the Universe, making their study essential for understanding both cosmology and the nature of dark matter itself. For example, \figref{fig:dm-models-haloes} illustrates the differences in the matter distribution in different self-interacting dark matter models gainst the standard $\Lambda$CDM.

\end{figure}

\section{Cosmological simulations}

These simulations often rely on N-body techniques to solve the non-linear gravitational interactions of a large number of particles in cosmological volumes. They usually take initial conditions produced by perturbative approximations in the linear regime starting from a density fluctuation generated with a given power spectrum. Cosmological simulations, particularly those employing the $\Lambda$CDM model, have been instrumental in studying dark matter haloes. Figure \ref{fig:dm-cosmo-sims-haloes} depicts the matter distribution simulated over a large cosmological volume consisting of a large number of haloes. Such cosmological simulations have revealed several key properties of dark matter haloes. For instance, haloes are generally triaxial in shape \citep[][]{1988ApJ...327..507F} and exhibit a universal density profile described by, for example, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile \citep{1996ApJ...462..563N,1997ApJ...490..493N,2010MNRAS.402...21N}.

\end{figure}

These simulations also reveal the distribution of these haloes in the cosmic web, such as the halo mass functions and assembly bias and its connection to the matter power spectrum. In addition, they are also useful in understanding the connections between these halo properties with the large-scale environment in which they reside \cite[see e.g.][]{2021MNRAS.503.2053R,2022MNRAS.516.5849R}.

\section{The Role of Dark Matter Haloes in Galaxy Formation}

Dark matter haloes are not only fundamental to cosmology but also to the formation and evolution of galaxies. Within these haloes, gas can cool and condense to form stars and other astrophysical objects \citep{1988MNRAS.234..459S,1998MNRAS.295..319M}. This process of baryonic matter within dark matter haloes is complex and involves various non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, star formation, and feedback mechanisms from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN).

Due to the complexity and wide dynamic range of these baryonic processes, it is challenging to study galaxy formation directly from first principles. Instead, semi-analytic models are often used, which incorporate simplified recipes for baryonic processes and are calibrated against observations \citep{2015ARA&A..53...51S}. These models allow for the efficient exploration of different galaxy formation scenarios but lack the full predictive power of direct simulations.

\section{Hydrodynamical Simulations}

The state-of-the-art approach to studying galaxy formation involves numerical hydrodynamical simulations that model both dark matter and baryonic physics within cosmological volumes. Hydrodynamical simulations, such as EAGLE \citep{2015Schaye_EAGLE} and IllustrisTNG \citep{2018MNRAS.480.5113M}, use subgrid models to incorporate processes that occur on scales smaller than the resolution of the simulation.

By incorporating radiative cooling, these simulations allow the gas to condense into the center, and when the gas becomes dense enough, some of its mass is converted into stellar particles that collectively track the evolution of a population of stars. This is also associated with the production of gas outflows due to stellar winds and supernovae feedback, enriching the interstellar gas with metals. In addition, they seed central supermassive black holes, forming active galactic nuclei that convert a part of the accreted energy into strong feedback outflows. The formation of such a galaxy in the cosmological setting is depicted in \figref{fig:illustrate-sim-eagle}.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:illustrate-sim-eagle}
\end{figure}

These subgrid prescriptions often include parameters that are only constrained by comparing against observational data. However, this approach is still one of the most realistic frameworks for studying the coupled evolution of dark matter and baryons in a cosmological setting. In particular, they account for the backreaction of galaxy formation on dark matter haloes, which can significantly alter the haloes' properties. For instance, the shape of dark matter haloes can be affected by the presence of a central galaxy \citep{2010MNRAS.407..435A,2021MNRAS.501.5679C}, which is important for interpreting weak lensing measurements \citep{2021A&A...647A.185G}. Additionally, the concentration and density profiles of dark matter haloes are modified by baryonic processes, influencing the rotation curves of galaxies.



\section{Self-similar evolution}

An alternate approach to studying the formation and evolution of haloes and galaxies is through the use of self-similar models. While this is not as accurate in producing realistic haloes or galaxies like the full hydrodynamical simulations, it provides more tractable analytical models that offer insights into key features. The key assumption is that the model is `self-similar', so that spatial variations are related to temporal variations through a scale radius that evolves over time. This reduces the nonlinear coupled partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/illustrate_self-sim_DM_shells.pdf}
\caption{Illustration of the self-similar accretion of collisionless dark matter shells onto a dark matter halo}
\end{figure}

The self-similar model was pioneered by Fillmore and Goldreich (1984) \cite{1984FillmoreGoldreich} and Bertschinger (1985) \cite{1985Bertschinger}. While Bertschinger devised spherical self-similar solutions for the collapse of dark matter and shocked gas within the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, under the assumption of a constant accretion rate, Fillmore and Goldreich explored self-similar solutions for the collapse of dark matter from various initial mass distributions, expanding their purview to include not only spherical but also cylindrical and planar self-similar collapses. 

Extending those works, Bertschinger (1989) \citep{1989Bertschinger} also studied self-similar cooling flows of gas, focusing on the inner regions of galaxies. In contrast, Owen et al. (1998) \citep{1998OwenWeinberg_etal} derived a set of cooling functions that guarantee self-similar evolution by ensuring that the cooling time-scale remains a constant fraction of the Hubble time in an object with a characteristic clustering mass. Abadi et al. (2000) \citep{2000Abadi_etal_SelfSimCool} studied the self-similar accretion of gas with radiative cooling in the EdS Universe.

Later on, Shi (2016a) \cite{2016ShiDMLamCDM} generalised self-similar models to Lambda-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) models, focusing on the outer profile and, notably, the outermost caustic or `splashback radius' of dark matter collapse which has gained recent popularity \cite{2014DiemerKrastov,2014AdhikariDalalChamberlain,2018Changetal_DES_splashback}.
In a complementary study, Shi (2016b) \cite{2016ShiICM} probed the self-similar accretion of shocked gas, dissecting its behavior with respect to accretion rates and revealing correlations between the shock radius of gas and the dark matter's splashback radius. In general, the self-similar assumption offers a powerful tool to simplify the problem and render it more tractable.

\section{Open Problems and Research Motivation}

Despite the advances in numerical simulations, there remain significant uncertainties regarding the effects of baryonic physics on dark matter haloes. Different simulations often produce varying results, reflecting the uncertainties in modeling complex baryonic processes. Understanding the response of dark matter haloes to baryonic interactions is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations and for making accurate predictions about the Universe's evolution.

From a cosmological perspective, the effects of baryons are often considered nuisances in the inference of fundamental parameters. For instance, feedback from AGN can mimic the effects of other cosmological parameters, such as the presence of massive neutrinos or warm dark matter candidates, at certain scales \citep{2019Chisari_etal_Baryfeedback,2020AricoAnguloetal_baryonifi}. Distinguishing between these effects requires a detailed understanding of baryonic processes and their impact on dark matter.

This thesis aims to address some of these open problems by investigating the response of dark matter to baryonic physics using state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. Specifically, it will focus on the role of baryonic astrophysical modeling in controlling halo relaxation and the evolution of haloes at early epochs. By leveraging the IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and CAMELS simulations, this work will explore the coupled evolution of dark matter and baryons and develop a self-similar model for galaxy formation. This research will contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between dark matter and baryonic processes, providing insights that are crucial for both cosmology and astrophysics.



% In the standard paradigm of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter haloes are formed from the gravitational collapse around initial overdensities - Galaxies are then formed the baryonic matter within the haloes - dark halo response to the galaxy formation - literature on adiabatic relaxation.

\section{Current status}
A detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies and their interaction with their environment is a pressing open problem. 
In the Lambda-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) picture of the Universe, the primary environment of any galaxy is provided by a `halo' of dark matter surrounding it \citep[e.g.,][]{wr78}. 
Therefore, understanding the dynamical behaviour of these dark haloes during the evolution of the galaxies they host is a key ingredient needed for building a complete picture of galaxy evolution.

% Dark haloes form through the gravitational collapse of overdensities that developed from tiny fluctuations in the initial distribution of matter (e.g., \citealp[][]{1974ApJ...187..425P}; for a review see \citealp{2002PhR...372....1C}). 
% The properties of dark haloes identified in gravity-only cosmological $N$-body simulations have been extensively studied in the literature. For example, while these haloes are known to be triaxial \citep[][]{1988ApJ...327..507F}, their sphericalised mass profiles are found to have a universal form (\citealp{1996ApJ...462..563N,1997ApJ...490..493N}, hereafter, NFW; see also \citealp{2010MNRAS.402...21N}). 
% However, as galaxies and clusters of galaxies form within these haloes from various non-gravitational baryonic interactions, their gravitational coupling to the dark matter can affect the spatial distribution and evolution of the latter. Understanding this response of a halo's dark matter content to the baryons it hosts is then critical for understanding the coupled evolution of haloes and galaxies. 

Early work treated this response using adiabatic invariants
\citep[][]{osti6457593,1984MNRAS.211..753B,1986ApJ...301...27B,1987ApJ...318...15R}. 
Using simplifying assumptions such as spherical symmetry, no shell crossing, angular momentum conservation with circular orbits for dark matter particles, \citet[][]{1986ApJ...301...27B} derived a simple formula that quantifies the adiabatic relaxation of the dark matter mass profile in terms of the final baryonic distribution (we discuss this in detail later). Besides the change in their mass profiles, dark haloes can also become more spherical as a result of galaxy formation \citep[][]{1994ApJ...431..617D}.
Currently, the most robust technique to understand the consequences of gas assembly and galaxy formation on dark matter structure is the use of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical (zoom) simulations, using `sub-grid' recipes for modelling very small-scale astrophysics such as feedback from stellar/supernovae activity or the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) (see, e.g., OWLS, \citealp{2010MNRAS.402.1536S}, Illustris; \citealp{2014MNRAS.445..175G}; FIRE, \citealp{2014MNRAS.445..581H}; EAGLE, \citealp{2015MNRAS.446..521S}; Horizon-AGN,
\citealp[][]{2017MNRAS.467.4739K}; SIMBA,
\citealp[][]{2019MNRAS.486.2827D}; IllustrisTNG, \citealp{2019ComAC...6....2N}). In such simulations, the response of the dark matter to the presence of baryons in a halo can be ascertained by comparing a halo in the full hydrodynamical simulation to a matched `partner' halo in a collisionless, gravity-only simulation performed using the same initial random fluctuations. 
Using this technique, it was found that a simple adiabatic contraction model like that of \citet[][]{1986ApJ...301...27B} is an inaccurate description of the response in a variety of simulations \citep[see, e.g.,][]{2004ApJ...616...16G,2006PhRvD..74l3522G,2010MNRAS.402..776P,2010MNRAS.406..922T,2010MNRAS.405.2161D,2010MNRAS.407..435A,2011MNRAS.414..195T,2016MNRAS.461.2658D,2019A&A...622A.197A,2022MNRAS.511.3910F}. Even in a simpler setting, where star formation and feedback effects are ignored, \citet{2010MNRAS.407..435A} found that the halo responds to the condensation of baryons to the center by becoming more spherical and compact, while the change in its mass profile is found to be significantly less than the prediction of the idealized adiabatic relaxation model.


Several authors have investigated whether discarding some of the assumptions of the idealized model of \citet[][]{1986ApJ...301...27B} can help reconcile with the simulation results. \citet{2004ApJ...616...16G} considered non-spherical orbits for the dark matter particles and suggested a simple modification to the original model. This modified empirical formula shows wide variation in its parameters across haloes from different simulations and at different redshifts \citep[][]{2006PhRvD..74l3522G,2010MNRAS.405.2161D}. On the other hand, \citet[][]{2005ApJ...634...70S} accounted for these random motions within the halo using invariant action integrals, following the method described in \citet{1980ApJ...242.1232Y}. This model gives a reasonably good approximation of the response even in modern hydrodynamical simulations \citep{2020MNRAS.495...12C}; 
however, making predictions using this model requires access to orbital phase space information of the halo, which may not always be feasible.

Physically, one expects that the overall response of the halo is mediated by a combination of different astrophysical processes that occur in the galaxy. Feedback processes are known to reduce the contraction of the halo significantly; e.g.,
supernova-driven winds can completely transform the inner density profile of the dark matter halo
\citep[][]{1996MNRAS.283L..72N}. This may be the key in reconciling the observation of dark matter cores at the center of various galaxies with the cuspy haloes found in gravity-only $\Lambda$CDM simulations \citep[see][for a review]{2014Natur.506..171P}.
However, such feedback effects do not always produce dark matter cores from cusps, rather, this can depend on the amount of gas ejected, the mass loss time scale and the frequency of starburst events 
(see, e.g., \citealp{2011ApJ...736L...2O,2014ApJ...793...46O,2012MNRAS.421.3464P}, and also \citealp{bfln18}).
In massive haloes hosting galaxy groups or clusters, while the formation of powerful AGN in the central galaxy can strongly suppress star formation,
it can still significantly reduce the adiabatic contraction of the halo \citep[][]{2011MNRAS.414..195T}.
Moreover, the fluctuation in gravitational potential due to such feedback can expel the dark matter from the inner halo producing inner cores \citep[][]{2012MNRAS.422.3081M}.

Different aspects of the halo response, such as the change in its mass profile, shape, phase space distribution and substructure population, have been explored to date in a variety of hydrodynamical simulations \citep[see, e.g.,][]{2004ApJ...611L..73K,2008ApJ...681.1076D,2014MNRAS.441.2986D,2015MNRAS.451.1247S,2017MNRAS.466.3876Z,2017MNRAS.472.4343C,2019MNRAS.484..476C,2021arXiv210900012C,2021MNRAS.501.5679C,2020MNRAS.494.4291C,freundlich+20,riggs+22}.
Understanding the nature of this response (or `baryonic backreaction') is critical in building accurate and robust models of halo shapes and sizes, for use in interpreting the results of upcoming large-volume surveys (\citealp{2015JCAP...12..049S,2018MNRAS.480.3962C,2021MNRAS.503.3596A}; see also \citealp{velliscig+14,hwvh15,mead+15}) as well as the detailed prediction of rotation curves and related statistics \citep{2021MNRAS.507..632P,2021arXiv211200026P}.
The goal of this chapter is to perform a systematic, statistical study of this dark matter response in high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations incorporating realistic feedback and quantify it using simple analytical forms, including the sensitivity of this response to halo-centric distance and halo and galaxy properties. To this end, we use the publicly available suites of simulations from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE projects.

\section*{Organization of the Thesis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the first chapter of this thesis, we review the background material and define the primary objectives, along with their relevance to the broader context.
    
    \item In the second chapter, we demonstrate the specific techniques we employed in studying the simulated response of dark matter haloes to galaxy formation and evolution within simulations of cosmological volumes.
    
    \item In the third chapter, we present our findings from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, characterizing the dark matter response in a wide variety of haloes at present epoch. We introduce novel fitting functions that accurately describe this relaxation response, revealing an additional dependence on halo-centric distance and highlighting the significant role of star formation-related feedback processes.
    
    \item In the fourth chapter, we explore the role of astrophysical modeling in producing the halo response at different epochs in simulations. We find the gas equation of state to have significant influence in EAGLE haloes, and we also quantify the strong influence of AGN and stellar feedback in CAMELS simulations. Our results show a more universal relaxation response at an earlier epoch ($z=1$) compared to $z=0$. These findings are applicable to semi-analytical tools for modeling galactic and large-scale structures.
    
    \item In the fifth chapter, we uncover the causal connections between star formation activities, feedback processes, and halo relaxation. Through time-series analyses, we provide new insights into the immediate and delayed effects across different halo regions. Our estimates of the timescales can potentially improve the description of halo profiles in existing baryonification schemes and semi-analytical galaxy formation models.

    \item In the sixth chapter, we develop a spherical self-similar model for galaxy formation that simultaneously and self-consistently solves for the evolution of gas and dark matter, producing pseudo galaxy disks within the halo. This complementary approach offers a framework to rapidly explore the sensitivity of halo response to various astrophysical processes. We find quasi-adiabatic halo relaxation similar to full non-linear simulations, with similarly strong trends related to the gas equation of state.

    \item In the seventh chapter, we summarize the key findings of this thesis and discuss the future outlook.
\end{itemize}
